# writings

Miscallaneous writings of mine relevant to CS or programming.

The SQLi (SQL injection) arose out of a desire to write a fairly comprehensive survey paper on the state of SQLi injection countermeasures in the literature. The plan is to submit this to ACM Transactions on Database Systems after I submit articles associted with my [astrophysical research project](https://github.com/Eli-mas/ResearchProject-RamPressure-EM-JK).

Other things here are problems that I explored for interest in my spare time or technical guides, which I will put up on a separate website when I decide which hosting service to use.

Note: internal links in jupyter (IPython) notebooks won't work when viewed here on github, but they will work when viewed on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
